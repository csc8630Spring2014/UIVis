UIVis
=====

<p>
End Goals:
  <br>
  User Interface for Project in CSC8630
  <br>
  Visualization of output for Project in CSC8630

<p>
Caveats:
  <br>
  UI will probably be a web front end as it is fairly easy, QT is also a possibility
  <br>
  Visualization will REQUIRE abstraction of the data to something that can be actually visualized
  <br>
  IE N-Dimensional data ---> 2D or 3D visualization

<p>
So, I am going to get input from clusterizer and graphiphier and I may send stuff to fetcher?

this is probably going to be a streaming of graph nodes... so i need to draw those correctly
